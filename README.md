**Purpose:**

Our game is something like this one: [Link](http://www.pacxon4u.com/space-invaders/), but our story starts with a brave ninja.<br />
You are a **Telerik ninja** and your task is to *take down all of the evil courses in game* - (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and CSharp).<br />
As u are ninja, *you can move and throw shuricanes*, but these mad courses are diffcult to get hit because they *are moving and shooting you*.<br />
You have three lives, but there's also **Speacial course** who can drop you extra life, or make you stronger when you kill him.
